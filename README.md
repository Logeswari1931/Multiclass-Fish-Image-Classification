# Multiclass-Fish-Image-Classification
This project classifies fish images into multiple categories using deep learning. It involves training a CNN from scratch and applying transfer learning with pre-trained models to improve accuracy. Trained models are saved and deployed through a Streamlit app that predicts fish categories from user-uploaded images.
